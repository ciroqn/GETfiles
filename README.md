# GETfiles
An example of GET method for dir files

## Example of GET Method
Following MDN's example of GET method for obtaining .txt files using a number of JS functions (onchange and onload) froM an XHR object.

### What is the Example?
This example essentially shows how a user can pick a verse from a Poe poem using a dropdown menu. Upon selection, this user input is processed using the XHR object.
We use a number of functions that allow the browser to display the relevant verse in a window (or div). In thise case we use <pre> tag to display the verse, since
we do not want to alter the structure of the poem's verse.

Note that, when the html file is run, in the (modern) browsers, the code will not execute as you would expect. Python must be used in the terminal to create a local
server.
